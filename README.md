# Outline
- Implementations of a few composite data structures in Python along with some characteristic algorithms accompanying each data type.

# Purpose
- In an attempt to further my abilities as a problem-solver and self-taught programmer who can write efficient and intentional code, I wanted to learn the more advanced data structures that don't ship with Python and learn their nuances and intricacies by implementing them myself.
- In doing so, I aim to learn how to identify which data structure is apt for the situation and can be used to make the script a lot more efficient.
- The accompanying algorithms help represent cases where the specific data structures can be applied, and serve as helpful guides.
